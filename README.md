# S.M.S Unix Version

This project is based on the [student-management-system](https://github.com/AveyBD/student-management-system) repository by **AveyDB**

I created this project with two objectives in mind: 
- Practice C language project 
- Create a version that uses Unix C libraries instead of Windows ones 

Also this project uses [C Project Template](https://github.com/pantuza/c-project-template) to generate the project structure and make file


## Warnings

To compile this project with no problems you will need to create two folders inside of the project:

`mkdir bin`
`mkdir lib`
